# Recent Updates

## Webhook Server Architecture Changes (2024-05-30)

### Changes Made
1. **Gunicorn Configuration**
   - Switched from Uvicorn worker to Gthread worker for better Flask compatibility
   - Added thread support (4 threads per worker)
   - Fixed WSGI app path to use correct module path
   - Configuration now properly handles Flask's WSGI nature

2. **Flask Webhook Server**
   - Improved async operation handling
   - Added ThreadPoolExecutor for better concurrency
   - Separated async HTTP client code into dedicated function
   - Implemented proper event loop management for async operations

### Technical Details
- Using `gthread` worker class instead of `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`
- Each worker now handles 4 threads for concurrent requests
- Async operations run in dedicated event loops
- HTTP client operations properly managed with context managers

### Dependencies
- Added `gevent` for thread support
- Using `httpx` for async HTTP requests
- Flask with async support enabled

### Performance Considerations
- Single worker with multiple threads for optimal resource usage
- Increased timeout for webhook processing (30 seconds)
- Proper connection pooling with httpx
- Efficient event loop management

### Monitoring
- All operations logged to stdout and webhook_server.log
- Health check endpoint available at `/health`
- Detailed error logging with stack traces

## Next Steps
1. Monitor performance with the new thread-based architecture
2. Consider adding metrics collection
3. Implement rate limiting if needed
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
