Okay, based on our progress with the conceptual implementation of Phase 2, here's an updated Product Requirements Document (PRD), a TODO list geared towards an implementer (like a developer or an AI coding assistant such as Cursor), and a plan for additional features.

Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Loophole Hackers Telegram Bot
Version: 1.1 (Post Phase 2 Conceptual Implementation)
Date: June 1, 2025

1. Summary
A custom Telegram bot to let builders at Loophole Hackers self-report project progress, reducing ops overhead and enabling automated tracking via Airtable. Deployed on Render, it serves as a lightweight interface for project creation, updates, and basic Browse via Telegram chat.

2. Objectives
Allow users to create and update project records directly via Telegram.
Automatically sync submissions to Airtable.
Send weekly reminders to update (pending implementation).
Reduce manual tracking and form fatigue.
Support future integrations and feature enhancements.
3. Core Features (Refined from Phase 2)
3.1. /newproject
Initiates a guided conversation to collect project details.
Collects:
Project name (Text)
One-liner tagline (Text)
Problem statement (Long text)
Tech stack (Free text)
GitHub or demo link (URL, requires validation)
Current stage (Idea, MVP, Launched - selected via Inline Keyboard)
Help needed (Free text)
Saves all information to the Projects table in Airtable, associating it with the user's Telegram ID.
Sets the Last Updated field upon creation.
3.2. /updateproject
If called directly, lists the user’s existing projects (fetched via Telegram ID from Airtable) using Inline Keyboard buttons for selection.
Can also be triggered via a callback button from the /myprojects command for a specific project.
Once a project is selected, initiates a conversation to collect:
Progress made this week (Long text)
Blockers (Long text, can be "None")
Saves the update to the Updates table in Airtable, linking to the parent project and including the user's Telegram ID and a timestamp.
Updates the Last Updated field in the corresponding Projects table record.
3.3. /myprojects
Fetches all projects associated with the user's Telegram ID from Airtable.
Returns a summarized list of projects (e.g., Name, Status, One-liner).
Each project in the list will have an Inline Keyboard button to directly trigger the /updateproject flow for that specific project.
3.4. /cancel
A command available during multi-step conversations (/newproject, /updateproject) to abort the current operation.
4. Database: Airtable
The database schema remains as initially defined.

4.1. Table: Projects

TODO List for Implementer (e.g., Cursor / Developer)
This list covers tasks to productionize the Phase 2 skeleton and move towards initial release.

Task Category: Code Refinement & Completion (from Phase 2 Skeleton)
T-1: Implement Robust Input Validation:
For /newproject -> GitHub/Demo link: Validate URL format.
Consider length limits for text fields to prevent abuse/errors and align with Airtable limits if any.
Sanitize inputs where necessary.
T-2: Enhance Error Handling & User Feedback:
In airtable_client.py: Provide more specific error messages for different API failure scenarios (e.g., auth error, not found, rate limit).
In app.py: Ensure all user interactions provide clear confirmation or error messages. For instance, if an Airtable call fails, inform the user gracefully.
T-3: Refine Conversation Flows:
Review all bot prompts and messages for clarity, conciseness, and tone.
Ensure /cancel command works reliably from all states of ConversationHandler.
T-4: Idempotency Check (Optional but good):
Consider if any operations need to be idempotent (e.g., preventing duplicate project creation on quick resubmission – Airtable typically handles unique record creation well, but bot flow might need checks).
Task Category: Conversation State Management
T-5: Upgrade Conversation State Persistence:
Research options: Redis, python-telegram-bot's PicklePersistence or DictPersistence (if appropriate for Render's filesystem and concurrency model), or a simple DB.
Implement the chosen persistent solution for user_data_store to replace the in-memory dictionary. This is critical for stability across bot restarts and potential scaling.
Task Category: Testing (Phase 3 Core)
T-6: Develop Unit Tests:
For airtable_client.py: Test functions like add_project, get_projects_by_user, add_update with mock Airtable responses.
For helper functions in app.py.
T-7: Develop Integration Tests:
Simulate Telegram updates for each command (/newproject, /updateproject, /myprojects) and verify the end-to-end flow, including Airtable interactions (can use a staging/test Airtable base).
T-8: Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Recruit a small group of target builders.
Provide them with test scenarios.
Collect feedback on usability, bugs, and overall experience.
Task Category: Deployment (Phase 3 Core)
T-9: Finalize Render Deployment Configuration:
Ensure Procfile (e.g., web: gunicorn app:application) is correct.
Set up all necessary environment variables on Render (API keys, webhook URL, table names, base ID).
Configure logging on Render to capture bot logs.
T-10: Securely Set Telegram Webhook:
Verify the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable is the correct public URL from Render.
Ensure the main() function in app.py correctly sets the webhook upon startup when WEBHOOK_URL is present.
Task Category: Initial Feature Implementation (from Objectives)
T-11: Implement Weekly Reminders:
Design Logic: Determine criteria (e.g., projects not updated in the last 7 days).
Create Script: A Python script that:
Fetches projects and their Last Updated dates from Airtable.
Identifies users needing reminders.
Uses the bot's token and telegram.Bot instance (or a direct API call) to send a reminder message to the Owner Telegram ID.
Schedule: Configure this script as a Cron Job on Render to run weekly.
Task Category: Documentation
T-12: Create User Guide:
Simple instructions on how to use /newproject, /updateproject, /myprojects, and /cancel.
T-13: Prepare Developer Documentation:
README with setup instructions (environment variables, dependencies).
Brief overview of the architecture.
Deployment steps for Render.
Plan for Additional Features (Post-Initial Release)
This outlines features to enhance the bot's utility, drawing from the PRD's future goals and adding some new ideas.

Tier 1: Enhancing Core Utility & Engagement
Weekly Digest Broadcast:

Description: Automatically compile a summary of project updates (e.g., new projects, significant progress on existing ones) from the Updates and Projects tables over the past week.
Implementation: A scheduled script (Render Cron Job) that formats this digest and broadcasts it to a designated Telegram group/channel. Could use simple text formatting or Markdown.
Value: Keeps everyone informed, encourages engagement.
LLM Summary of Updates:

Description: For projects with lengthy text updates in the Updates table, use an LLM (e.g., via an API) to generate a concise summary (1-2 sentences).
Implementation: Integrate an LLM API call after an update is submitted or as part of the weekly digest generation. Store summary in a new Airtable field or use it ephemerally.
Value: Makes digests more scannable and highlights key progress.
Improved /help Command & Onboarding:

Description: A comprehensive /help command explaining all features, syntax, and providing tips. Improve the initial interaction for new users.
Implementation: Static text messages or a more interactive guided help.
Value: Better user experience, reduces support questions.
Project Search/Browse by Criteria:

Description: Allow users to search or filter projects within Telegram using commands like /findproject <keyword> or /browse --stack Python --status MVP.
Implementation: Extend airtable_client.py with more advanced querying capabilities. Use conversation flow or command arguments to get search criteria.
Value: Helps users discover projects and find specific information.
Tier 2: Collaboration & Community Building
Contributor Matchmaking (Basic):

Description: Extend the "Help Needed" field to be more structured (e.g., predefined skill tags). Allow users to express interest in helping or search for projects needing specific skills.
Implementation: Modify /newproject and /updateproject to capture structured help requests. Add new commands like /findhelp or /offerhelp.
Value: Facilitates collaboration within the community.
User Profiles/Skills:

Description: Allow builders to create a simple profile within the bot, listing their skills, interests, or projects they're proud of.
Implementation: New Airtable table for UserProfiles linked to Telegram ID. New commands like /myprofile and /setskill.
Value: Enhances matchmaking, helps users get to know each other.
Role-Based Help Requests:

Description: A more formal way to request specific roles (e.g., "Need: UI/UX Designer for 2 weeks").
Implementation: Could build on contributor matchmaking by adding duration, commitment level, etc., to help requests.
Value: More effective at sourcing specific help.
Tier 3: Integrations & Advanced Features
Notion Sync or Embed:

Description: Allow project data from Airtable to be synced to a Notion database or provide an easily embeddable view for a public/internal Notion page.
Implementation: Could involve Airtable Automations syncing to Notion, or a separate service/script using both Airtable and Notion APIs. For embedding, explore Airtable's embed features.
Value: Wider visibility of project data, leverages Notion's documentation strengths.
Admin Panel/Dashboard (Simple):

Description: A basic web interface (could be an internal tool or a more complex Airtable interface) for admins to view bot usage statistics, manage projects (e.g., edit/archive), or view logs.
Implementation: Could leverage Airtable's own interface views and dashboards, or build a simple separate Flask web app.
Value: Better oversight and management capabilities.
Notification Preferences:

Description: Allow users to customize which notifications they receive (e.g., opt-out of weekly digests, only get reminders for their own projects).
Implementation: Store preferences in Airtable (linked to user ID) and check them before sending notifications.
Value: Reduces notification fatigue, respects user preferences.
